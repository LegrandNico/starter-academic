I am a postdoctoral fellow in the [Embodied Computation Group](https://the-ecg.org) under the supervision of Micah Allen. My researches focus on memory, metacognition and brain-body interactions using brain imaging, computational models and physiological signal analysis.

I am the creator of several open source Python libraries: [Systole](https://github.com/embodied-computation-group/systole) (cardiac and respiratory signal analysis), Cardioception (Measuring interoceptive performance with Psychopy) and [metadPy](https://github.com/LegrandNico/metadPy) (fitting Hierarchical Bayesian models of confidence ratings using PyMC3).
