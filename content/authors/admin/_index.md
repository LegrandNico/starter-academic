I am a postdoctoral fellow in the Embodied Computation Group (https://the-ecg.org) under the supervision of Micah Allen. My researches focus on memory, metacognition and brain-body interactions using brain imaging, computational models and physiological signal analysis. I am the creator and maintainer of Systole (a Python package for cardiac and respiratory signal analysis, https://github.com/embodied-computation-group/systole), Cardioception (a Python package for measuring interoceptive metacognition) and metadPy (a Python package based on pymc3 to fit Hierarchical Bayesian models of confidence ratings, https://github.com/LegrandNico/metadPy).

I completed studies in both Philosophy and Applied Mathematics in Grenoble (UPMF). I obtained a Master’s degree in Cognitive science at the University of Lyon 2 where I specialized in Philosophy of Mind, and a second Master's degree in the University of Caen with a specialization in neuropsychology. I completed my PhD on collective memory and memory suppression under the supervision of Francis Eustache and Denis Peschanski (http://nimh.unicaen.fr/fr/accueil/).
