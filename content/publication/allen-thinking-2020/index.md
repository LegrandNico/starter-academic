abstract: Abstract The Bayesian brain hypothesis, as formalized by the free-energy
  principle, is ascendant in cognitive science. But, how does the Bayesian brain obtain
  prior beliefs? Veissière and colleagues argue that sociocultural interaction is
  one important source. We offer a complementary model in which “interoceptive self-inference”
  guides the estimation of expected uncertainty both in ourselves and in our social
  conspecifics.
