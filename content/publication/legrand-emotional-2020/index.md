abstract: Abstract Emotion alters how we feel, see, and experience the world. In the
  domain of memory, the emotional valence and arousal of memorized stimuli can modulate
  both the acuity and content of episodic recall. However, no experiment has investigated
  whether arousal and valence also influence metacognition for memory (i.e., the process
  of self-monitoring memories). In a pre-registered study, we applied a novel psychophysiological
  design together with computational models of metacognition to assess the influence
  of stimulus valence and arousal on the sensitivity, bias, and efficiency of metamemory.
  To estimate the role of physiological arousal in mediating these effects, we recorded
  cardiac measures through pulse oximetry. We found that negative valence globally
  and substantially decreased both memory performance and subjective confidence, in
  particular for low-arousal words. Simultaneously, we found that emotional valence
  modulated both heart rate and heart-rate variability (HRV), indicating a robust
  effect of negative valence on physiological arousal during recognition memory. Exploratory
  trial-level analyses further revealed that subjective confidence was encoded in
  instantaneous heart-rate fluctuations, and that this relationship was modulated
  by emotional valence. Our results demonstrate that both recognition memory and metacognition
  are influenced by the emotional contents of encoded items and that this correlation
  is in part related to cardiac activity.
