abstract: Abstract Efforts to exclude past experiences from conscious awareness can
  lead to forgetting. Memory suppression is central to affective disorders, but we
  still do not really know whether emotions, including their physiological causes,
  are also impacted by this process in normal functioning individuals. In two studies,
  we measured the after-effects of suppressing negative memories on cardiac response
  in healthy participants. Results of Study 1 revealed that efficient control of memories
  was associated with long-term inhibition of the cardiac deceleration that is normally
  induced by disgusting stimuli. Attempts to suppress sad memories, by contrast, aggravated
  the cardiac response, an effect that was closely related to the inability to forget
  this specific material. In Study 2, electroencephalography revealed a reduction
  in power in the theta (3–8 Hz), alpha (8–12 Hz) and low-beta (13–20 Hz) bands during
  the suppression of unwanted memories, compared with their voluntary recall. Interestingly,
  however, the reduction of power in the theta frequency band during memory control
  was related to a subsequent inhibition of the cardiac response. These results provide
  a neurophysiological basis for the influence of memory control mechanisms on the
  cardiac system, opening up new avenues and questions for treating intrusive memories
  using motivated forgetting.
