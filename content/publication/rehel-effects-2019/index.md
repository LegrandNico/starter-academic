abstract: Prospective memory (PM) refers to our ability to perform actions at the
  appropriate moment, either when a predetermined event occurs (event-based, EB) or
  after a predetermined amount of time (time-based, TB). Sleep favors the consolidation
  of both EB and TB intentions, but whether this benefit is preserved during ageing
  is still subject to debate. PM was assessed in 28 young and 27 older healthy volunteers
  using a virtual environment. Participants had to learn and execute intentions after
  intervals filled with either daytime wakefulness or nighttime sleep. Intentions
  consisted of four TB, four EB with a strong link between the cue triggering retrieval
  and the action to be performed (EB-link) and four with no link (EB-nolink). PM was
  not affected by age, whatever the type of intention and the nature of the retention
  interval. While sleep reinforced all types of intentions in young participants,
  this benefit was only observed for TB and EB-link intentions in older adults. Sleep
  also reinforced the intrinsic PM components in both groups. Thus, when assessed
  using complex realistic situations, PM is not impaired in ageing. Results are discussed
  in the light of memory schema theory and the possible impact of cognitive reserve
  on sleep and memory.
